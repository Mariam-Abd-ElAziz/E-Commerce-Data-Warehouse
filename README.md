# E-commerce Data Warehouse

## üìå Project Overview
This project is a data warehouse designed for an e-commerce platform. It supports business decision-making by enabling efficient querying and reporting on customer behavior, sales trends, campaign performance, and return analysis.
Here‚Äôs how you can enhance your project documentation by adding **Prerequisites** and **Steps to Start the Project**:

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Before starting the project, ensure you have the following tools and configurations set up:

1. **SQL Server** (2016 or later recommended)

   * Installed and running locally or on a server
   * SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) for query execution
2. **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**

   * Installed via Visual Studio (with Data Tools)
3. **Power BI Desktop**

   * For dashboard development and reporting
4. **Project Files**

   * `load_source_data.sql`: Script to populate OLTP database
   * `create_DWH.sql`: Script to create Data Warehouse schema
   * SSIS project for ETL
5. **Basic Knowledge**

   * SQL, Data Warehousing concepts, and ETL processes


## üöÄ Steps to Start the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the e-commerce data warehouse:

### 1. **Set Up the OLTP Database**

* Open `source_oltp_data.sql` in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
* Execute the script to create and populate the OLTP source database.

### 2. **Create the Data Warehouse Schema**

* Open `create_dwh_schema.sql` in SSMS.
* Execute the script to create fact and dimension tables in your data warehouse database (e.g., `DWH_Ecommerce`).

### 3. **Configure SSIS Project**

* Open the SSIS solution in Visual Studio.
* Update **connection managers** to point to:

  * Your OLTP database (source)
  * Your DWH database (destination)
* Review and test data flow tasks to ensure mappings and transformations are accurate.

### 4. **Run ETL Process**

* In Visual Studio, right-click the SSIS package and run it to perform the initial ETL load.
* Confirm data is populated correctly in the data warehouse.


## üí° Business Processes Modeled
